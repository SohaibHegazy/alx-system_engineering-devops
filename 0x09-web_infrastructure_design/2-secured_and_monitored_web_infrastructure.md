For every additional element, why you are adding it?

I added the new firewalls at each node to provide security. Also, I added the SSL certificate to insure the encryption of data. The addition of 3 monitoring clients, one at each node and one at the load balancer to monitor the status of them and alert the administrator to act accordingly
